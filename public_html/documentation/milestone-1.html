<h1>Milestone 1</h1>
<h2>Purpose, Audience, and Goal</h2>
<div>
    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <p>This project is an organizational website focused on portraying a welcoming atmosphere and providing up-to-date information about organizational events.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Audience:</h3>
    <p>The organization is a church youth group that creates a safe space for middle-school and high-school students to connect together in northwest Albuquerque. The site is designed for all stakeholders within the community. That includes teenagers who are active members of the group, potential new participants, parents of said participants, and volunteers. </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Goal:</h3>
    <p>The primary goal of the site is to provide up-to-date information about organizational events. A secondary goal is to open up an additional channel with parents of participants. Teenagers often do not communicate well with their parents, but the site allows parents to receive organizational information on their own terms which will allow them to feel more connected to the organization.</p>
</div>
<h2>Persona</h2>
<div>
    <h3>Name:</h3>
    <p>Chris Johnson</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Profession:</h3>
    <p>Chris is a retired Air Force veteran who spent 20 years on the flight-line as a mechanic but now works at Home Depot. </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Technology Use:</h3>
    <p>Chris has a 3-year old HP laptop that runs Windows 10. He uses it for e-mail, bill payments, and some classes he has been taking at the community college. Chris has an Samsung Galaxy S21 that he uses to get all the latest pictures of his grand-children and watch youtube videos about home DIY projects. He also has a Fitbit that he uses to keep track of his hikes and regular runs.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Attitudes and Behaviors:</h3>
    <p>Chris has spent much of his life adapting to new locations. This means he is experienced at integrating into new communities but also that he is wary of other people. The Air Force taught him that not everyone can be trusted.</p>
    <p>Chris' family is his top priority. He knows moving frequently is difficult on his kids and so he is always looking for a good opportunity for his kids to connect with other people.</p>
    <p>Chris is not afraid of technology. He has used it consistently most of his life and had many younger co-workers in the Air Force who kept him up-to-date. However, now that his three children are teenagers or older, Chris frequently feels behind on current technology trends. When his kids bring up the Tiktok, Chris likes to reminisce about old technologies like VCRs and flip-phones. </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Needs:</h3>
    <p>Chris wants his son to have a safe place to connect with other teenagers in the area. In addition to that, Chris would like to get a feel any groups his son is a member of and to be kept up-to-date on planned events. Chris' son is not a great communicator, and Chris is often the last person in the family to find out anything, so he needs to have a way to easily get information from the source.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Frustrations:</h3>
    <p>Chris gets frustrated when he is informed about an activity that his teenage son wants to attend, a mere couple hours before it is supposed to occur. He also feels uneasy about dropping his son off for events that Chris is relatively unfamiliar with.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Goals:</h3>
    <p>Chris wants two things. First, he would like a website that would allow him to become more familiar with the activities that his son is a part of. Secondly, he wants the details about dates and times in advance so that he can plan his schedule accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>User Story:</h3>
    <p>As a parent of a teenager involved in a local church, I need a website that is easy to navigate and will quickly provide information on the activities my teenager will be participating in.</p>
